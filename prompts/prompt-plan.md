# Voice Consistency Guidelines
## Maintaining Persona Authenticity
* Each persona must maintain consistent:
  - Vocabulary choices
  - Sentence structure
  - Reference types
  - Analytical approach
  - Emotional tone
* Avoid mixing perspectives within sections
* Use persona-specific metaphors and analogies
* Maintain consistent level of technical detail

## Voice Check Questions
For each section, verify:
1. Does the language match the persona's expertise level?
2. Are the references appropriate for this perspective?
3. Is the emotional tone consistent?
4. Does the analysis depth match the persona's background?
5. Are the examples aligned with the persona's typical interests?

# Fallback Strategies
## When Requirements Can't Be Met
1. Original Framework Missing
   * Use a modified version of an existing framework
   * Combine multiple frameworks in a novel way
   * Create a simplified but original approach

2. Reference Limitations
   * Focus on quality over quantity
   * Use more detailed analysis of fewer references
   * Draw from related genres or time periods

3. Technical Analysis Challenges
   * Focus on accessible elements
   * Use descriptive analysis
   * Reference similar patterns in other works

4. Data Availability Issues
   * Use qualitative analysis
   * Focus on observable patterns
   * Draw from personal expertise

# Example Section
Here's an example of a completed section for The Practitioner persona:

```markdown
## Musical Analysis Section

### Original Analytical Framework: "Rhythmic Architecture"
A novel approach examining how rhythmic patterns create structural tension and release, independent of harmonic progression.

### Specific Musical Elements
1. Syncopation Patterns (0:45-1:15)
   * Complex cross-rhythms between bass and drums
   * Reference: Similar to "So What" by Miles Davis (1:20-1:50)
   * Technical breakdown of 3:2 polyrhythm implementation
   * Justification: This section demonstrates the most complex rhythmic interplay

2. Harmonic Rhythm (2:30-3:00)
   * Unusual chord progression timing
   * Reference: Echoes of "Giant Steps" by John Coltrane
   * Analysis of tension-building techniques
   * Justification: This section shows the most innovative harmonic movement

### Supporting Examples
* Detailed transcription of key rhythmic patterns
* Visual representation of rhythmic architecture
* Comparison with traditional approaches

### Key References
* Technical analysis of similar patterns in [Reference Song 1]
* Historical context from [Reference Song 2]
* Contemporary applications in [Reference Song 3]
