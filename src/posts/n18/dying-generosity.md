I was thinking about my childhood friend who died when she was 14 yo. And then I remembered this song from Queen they wrote when Freddie Mercury died. I needed a hint to understand my grief even though I'm full of thoughts.

The title of the song theorizes that only the good die young because they fly too close to the sun. Life goes on without them even though the debate about death is still open. Death is the BIG subject, and I might blog about it in the near future.

Then I thought that if you're right and kind and generous, then the song "Bad" from Michael Jackson might give us a clue. The song is very explicit like a porn movie: "your butt is mine." This means not only it's incredibly violent, but it's also related to the anal stage Freud talked about.

I guess we'll never understand why people die so early. After all, after 90 years, you could expect people could get tired of all the evil schemes someone is plotting. Revenge will surely come.

## Is It So Disturbing To Think You Belong To Someone?

![you belong poster](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1635011756521-005b4cb6f341?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

We have to have faith in the sound: I don't belong to you, and you don't belong to me! Freedom! I guess many people understand what I mean.

Even Foxy Brown was tired of being "married to the firm, you got to understand." It's funny because many people can look for a place where they belong. Radiohead used to sing in "Creep" he didn't belong here.

Maybe you're just a stepping stone, and you don't have to worry. Perhaps it's only small talk, and you will see on the dance floor if you belong or not. I guess if we want to end that stupid fight, we must make a choice: only the dance floor will give us the right answers.

I'm not saying freedom of speech should be carefully monitored. But the answers we seek can only be found on the floor when you're watching the night sky and the small dots.

## Does Saturday Night Allow You To Make Everything Alright?

![A blurry shot of a city street lit up by buildings and cars at night](https://images.unsplash.com/uploads/1413259835094dcdeb9d3/6e609595?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

What do I have to lose if I'm leaving this school? Should I leave the planet too? Why not wait until Saturday night to see if the severity of the situation isn't exaggerated too much?

They say Saturday night's alright for fighting. But we're dancing with the dead because of that awful climate Paris has demonstrated regularly. Curiosity isn't a bad thing, but watch out for those exotic influences from the East. If you take them too seriously, you will end up in a fight.

A society without class: this is what they're fighting for. Yes, I'm talking about communists. I guess they didn't want to worship the ancients who did a lot of things before them.

Anyway, Saturday night should provide you with a lot of answers. Lately, the responses from Saturday come from the Quadrangle in Hazmieh, Lebanon. A standard of performance, an excellent pizza, and a few beers. Guilt must be related to a standard.

## What Compensation For A Heart Stuck In The Anal Stage?

Women are in charge of everything related to cleanliness. I feel like trash at the moment, and I'm wondering who was the woman behind this evil scheme. It seems the woman was kidnapped and had to embrace the faith of the aggressor. But she wants to come back where she belongs.

No, let's be honest: if I feel like trash and nobody can make me feel clean, it's because the woman was from Syria. I'm not talking about Asma al-Assad even though I have a hint to cure the worst diseases.

The woman that trashed me in the can of astronomy forgot I had friends I can count on. I had a B+ in astronomy when I was 18 yo. Maybe we're not that significant, but again it will depend: my last effort has produced several exciting ideas.

I guess then the compensation could travel in the big universe above us. And maybe we are all stars separated by an ocean of darkness. Can you see me shine when the weather is fantastic?

## Should You Ask Questions When You Expect A Lie?

In conclusion, being pessimistic is, of course, a way to play on the safe side, so you don't get hurt. But being realistic is so much more interesting if you want to win. What's wrong with generosity? What's wrong with propriety?

Thomas Piketty (born 7 May 1971) is a French economist whose work focuses on wealth and income inequality. He is a professor at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS), associate chair at the Paris School of Economics and Centennial professor at the International Inequalities Institute, which is part of the London School of Economics (LSE).

Piketty is the author of the best-selling book Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2013), which emphasizes the themes of his work on wealth concentrations and distribution over the past 250 years.

Piketty was summarising his work in a talk show recently: everything related to propriety is violent. Should you wait for Saturday night to discover where your butt belongs? In the long run, can we become too rigid or too disordered?

Life is a scandal, and it's harder and harder, to tell the truth from the lies. The only thing I'm sure of is the following: don't be stupid, naive, or unreachable.
