Yesterday, I was showing a travel blog called "The Blonde Abroad" to a brunette travel agent. The travel blog has been featured in Forbes, and Kiersten Rich (the author) went from 90 daily visitors in 2012 to millions as of today.

I feel that hair color debate is like the skin color debate: today, racism is severely frowned upon; furthermore, we need brunettes and blonde equally even if they blog about different subjects.

You can't deny the fact that Kiersten Rich feels like sunshine for a lot of corporate people stuck in 9 to 5 jobs. I know, you're going to tell me that some people work 7 to 11, and Led Zeppelin is their heroes.

## The Hidden Reason Why You're Feeling A Little Peculiar

I lost all my hair in 2002, when I was 22 years old. But my hair color was dark, and I still have hair outside of the top of the head. There must be a reason why men lose hair at the top.

The color of your hair is as important as the color of your skin. But the reason you're feeling peculiar is that you try to get out what's in your head.

Yes, the hidden reason behind your singularity is whether you're paying attention to what's in your head or not. When I pay attention to my head, I tend to forget that our digestive system is like a 2nd brain.

You're feeling peculiar because sometimes your head and liver are playing tricks on you. But what's in the head of a blonde or brunette?

## Is Life A Chaotic Journey Or A Stupid Destination?

Kiersten Rich did some soul searching after four years in corporate finance. Traveling alone, she discovered it was empowering to move. But you and I know traveling creates a complex identity.

It's not the case for Kiersten. She remained the woman who decided to share her passion for travel. And I'm doing the same on that music blog: I wanted to share my love for music and witty conversation.

I remember that time when I met an American girl working for a pharmaceutical company. She said, "at first she found me dorky, but when she started to know me, she felt I was cute."

I do think life's a journey AND a destination. After all, if you can't settle a few hours somewhere, aren't we like those restless hearts that never mend?

## The Best Method To Get Rid Of Your Heartache

![three black labeled bottles](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557043728-3edef94d093b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

If your heartache is here to stay, then we know why Rich decided to travel. She wanted to forget or maybe think about her life a little. Everybody was pointing their finger at her. Yet she has that unquestionably awe-inspiring mix of girl and woman in her head.

Rich decided that to get over that bright future she will have following the rules, she has to find a new destination. Any health expert can talk to you about the role of new neurons in the brain.

It seems not only Rich had a heartache thinking about the future. Those 4 nonblondes singing at the end of the post were talking about hope.

To get over that heartache, answer the question: what's new? But what if a brunette could also be like sunshine for you?

## Is The Big Secret In The Cheese?

![man in white dress shirt wearing black framed eyeglasses](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1603792907191-89e55f70099a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

Sometimes I talk with different people by email or phone. Some are tall, some are normal, and some are far away. But in every case, it's casual entertainment until you can get everybody at someplace for a big party.

The big secret of colors is how it resonates with your soul. Some like to be near a blonde on a gray day full of clouds. Some like it hot like Marylin Monroe.

But given the complexity of life, can we say the head of a blonde isn't the same head that the one of a brunette? They must have something in common! I think the secret is in the cheese, which means the smell (if you translate).

The big secret is the smell and the senses and how it resonates with your soul.

## After The Easy Hill Is There A Complex Mountain?

![mountain ranges](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1532424317259-e21a9f99c2e4?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

All in all, our diversity is what makes our universe beautiful. Without the blonde, what would be the worth of being a brunette? Without a person spending her time traveling, what would be the life of our 9 to 5 and 7 to 11 people?

You shouldn't be angry if you're not blonde. Brunettes have a pleasant personality, even though they might be upset too often.

When you're 25, does it matter the color of your hair? Do you see the light at the end of the tunnel? Is she blonde or a brunette with a lighter? (so handy if you smoke)

Now we should try to get blondes and brunette to blog to see what's in their head. Of course, you will feel a little peculiar because you might stumble upon colors you never knew! :)
