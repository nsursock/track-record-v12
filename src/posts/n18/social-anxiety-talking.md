I think we all had to face that one day: you're in a social gathering, and nobody talks to you. The anxiety that results from that treatment means you're experiencing oppression as if you were in a totalitarian state.

Oppression means prolonged cruel or unjust treatment. Needless to say, it's as if you were being tortured and squeezed for information on a national security matter. So waterboarding is not far away.

People need to know you, and you need to know people. If no one knows your work and what you have achieved, it's your responsibility to introduce yourself. Otherwise, you will begin to feel empty and used up.

I get it: someone brings you into a room full of people, and they act real rude to you. And remember: if you run away, you will feel guilty.

## Is It So Disturbing To Imagine People Needing A Purpose?

Having a purpose in life is vitally important! Studies have shown that having a goal leads to a longer, healthier, wealthier life. According to a 2010 study, people who have a purpose live longer.

So if you get to know people and use them for a purpose, you're doing them a favor. But, of course, everybody is using everybody to attain their goals.

A sense of purpose is usually located in what brings you joy.

If you find a role for people, they will perceive you as dominant and assertive. And we all know that's how you want to be perceived. Politics is about power relations.

People have fought oppression throughout history, and it's too bad a vague social gathering triggers the same feelings as Mel Gibson in Braveheart.

## Will People Stop Looking Back In Anger Or Sadness?

Whether you want it or not, life is a game, and you need to surround yourself correctly. I once was blocked by someone I don't know and never contacted on Twitter, maybe because of the company I keep. The person's role in my life wasn't clear, and she preferred to ignore my existence.

Social media can also create that feeling of oppression, and periodically you witness someone writing they are leaving social media for a while to experience freedom again.

But if you understand the role of a person and how you can use them to achieve your goals, you can thank them later because that's all people want from relationships. They want to achieve their goals.

You will gain much respect that way. I'm a web developer, and I have ten years of experience in computer science. I know a thing or two about coding, but I didn't know shit about web dev one year ago. Thanks to the fantastic community that answered my questions, I quickly created several websites.

## Do You Mind Going Through This Shit With Me And Share A Memory?

If you start using people, you will have shared experiences you can tell your grandchildren. So you will have something in common. But, of course, that reminds you you need to set boundaries because someone will try to use you.

What's wrong with being used? It has a negative connotation and is the weapon of choice of manipulators. But when you look at it from a positive point of view, you realize you can be helpful and achieve something.

Shared experiences and common goals can make you realize we're all part of something bigger than us. Think of a sports team and how the coach uses one player for a particular task. Using people must be made commonplace, and this will set you free.

## But What If There's No More Fuel Left In The Tank?

All in all, everybody is using everybody to achieve their goals, and the only important question is this: what if one day you wake up and you feel empty? Who will comfort you and fill you with that delicious fluid allowing you to get moving?

That's why it's crucial to set boundaries in social situations.

You want to be dominant, you want to be respected, you want to share experiences. But more importantly, you want to have enough gas to go back home. It's so lovely to have a purpose that you won't mind one day being used.

If you ask the right questions, you can become free of social anxiety. For example, are you afraid to be used and not have enough left? And remember, everyone might have the same fears and desires as you.
