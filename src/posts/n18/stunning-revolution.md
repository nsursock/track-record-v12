At the time of writing, I'm in Beirut listening to an Arabic version of Bella Ciao. "Bella ciao" ("Goodbye beautiful") is an Italian folk song that was adopted as an anthem of the anti-fascist resistance.

It was used by the Italian partisans between 1943 and 1945 during the Italian Resistance, or the resistance of Italian partisans against the Nazi German forces occupying Italy, and during the Italian Civil War, or the Italian partisan struggle against the fascist Italian Social Republic and its Nazi German allies. "Bella ciao" is used worldwide as an anti-fascist hymn of freedom and resistance.

The song has much older origins though in the hardships of the mondina women, the paddy field workers in the late 19th century who sang it as a protest against harsh working conditions in the paddy fields in North Italy.

Anyway the title of the post could be: "Goodbye Doctor". Today I don't have enough money to pay a psychological support. I lived 20 years in Paris and I want to live in Beirut. It's a rather disturbing experience and the only thing I can rely on is music.

## It's Strange How History Can Repeat Itself.

As long as there are monsters, there will be revolutions. Spending most of his/her time with an acid trip, the monster will always be a disciple of Freud willing to do to innocent people what someone did to him/her.

It's a funny world we're living in because sometimes strange things happen in the neighbourhood. You can become crazy and old easily. I'm not saying being old is a bad thing but, like a fine wine, spend time in the cave.

They say with revolutions history doesn't repeat itself. For example, one man's loss is another man's gain. Or maybe you're drunk with rivalry and vengeance.

With the revolution, we don't want to make the same mistakes than in the past. Errare humanum est sed perseverare diabolicum.

## Are Revolutions A Remarkable Result Of An Oral Fixation?

![long black haired woman smiling close-up photography](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1489278353717-f64c6ee8a4d2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

In Freudian psychoanalysis, the term oral stage or hemitaxia denotes the first psychosexual development stage wherein the mouth of the infant is his or her primary erogenous zone.

Spanning the life period from birth to the age of 18 months, the oral stage is the first of the five Freudian psychosexual development stages: (i) the oral, (ii) the anal, (iii) the phallic, (iv) the latent, and (v) the genital. Moreover, because it is the infant's first human relationship—biological (nutritive) and psychological (emotional)—its duration depends upon the child-rearing mores of the mother's society.

Maybe the population feel like they're maximum 18 months: they feel like a child and they need to explain the war. Instead of giving us 4% of what is due to us, they created a new tax. We feel like a new born every day with a birth trauma. The bitterness inside grows.

## Can You Get Some Sleep And Do You Know What To Do?

I'm not taking part in the revolution except maybe spending time in a coffee shop. Maybe this blog can inspire some good things. What I know is that "if we tolerate this, our children will be next". What do I mean by "this" exactly?

The toxic artwork of Alois Brunner of course: before dying, he decided to send a last message of terror and rape. While I enjoy some riddles, I must say I wanted to focus on music and signal processing. I don't have an education in criminology except maybe for some basic stuff.

Once I had the life of a healthy person: I got over things quickly and had fun with simple things. Then I began to fall or stumble, I don't know: they took a stone from our souls while we were lame. And I think my cancer is here because of that: you are not allowed to experience fatigue and rest.

## Newspaper Shout Because Whispering Can Make You Dizzy.

![neon sign hinting at shout](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611164322025-2f5a1b4cf53d?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

As a conclusion, whispering is much more fun than shouting. But I guess sometimes you have to shout: let it all out! These are the things I can do without.

As far as I'm concerned these are the things I can do without: a balance between work and life. Seeing my loved ones from time to time for a mighty good time. And being able to go back to Syria to watch the stars and an eclipse (like in 1999).

Assad warned Lebanon that we couldn't remain out of the fire of the region. Syria beat us bad since the 1970s but they only managed the country like a school. This means if we survive there is a good chance we might know a lot.

Now I'm going to testify: Syria's secret police was operating near my home in Paris for many years, bullying me at school and at work. No doubt this crisis is a crisis from school. What can be the solution then?

I guess we don't have a choice: we have to come out and play. But relax a little bit: if we're under 18 we won't be doing any time. And then philosophy will become insignificant.
