Yesterday I asked someone I met to be friends on Facebook. We met like 2 years ago maybe; I don't remember when but I remember the place. Anyway, I'm sitting next to people in a coffee shop, and I can hear their conversation: one girl mentions it takes 3 months to get over a bad trip.

Are drugs that bad? After all, they're just giving a direction to the brain which is in charge of accounting. Maybe there's a drug that can credit your bank account with a nice amount in 3 months (for example, 50,000â‚¬). Or perhaps you're already rich and beautiful, but something is playing a game on you.

Would you choose water over wine? And can you change water into wine?

Right now, I chose coffee over water and wine. It seems coffee is a powerful drug, but there's only one condition: you have to remain calm. Maybe a cigarette could be nice with that coffee, and the equation becomes simple:
 1. caffeine makes you scream to stop the witchcraft of the rain and the steam,
 2. nicotine makes you start your company with awesome solutions.

Lately, I was blogging about MDMA (aka ecstasy): 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. With that kind of name, please rest assured the trip will be complex. It might be why you experience bad beats.

## How Long Until You Reach Normal Dimensions?

In 2013, I went into the French alps to participate in a special cure. During 3 weeks, the planning was rather interesting:
 - you wake up and rush to experience a massage and a shower,
 - you can participate twice a day in walks in nature (morning and afternoon),
 - lunch and dinner are served and were cooked by a special chef,
 - you can try yoga if your mind is open enough,
 - your spare time should be used to study something you love.

When I came back to Paris, I almost fell seriously ill but got myself together. Then for 6 months, I tried to keep that same old feeling and lost 20 kilos in 6 months. Of course, I had something in mind, like having a great musical career.

## How Long Before A Business Takes Off?

This paragraph will be about the business person in you. For a regular business, don't expect results before 2 years. If you quit before 2 years of work, you will never experience the high.

This blogging advice is from a reputable source that Neil Patel cited in one of his posts. They were saying that, if there's only one piece of advice to follow, this is the one: most people give up after 9 months, and you have to wait 2 years before you see success.

The conclusion is natural to see: if you don't see success after 3 years, it's time to think about what you do. Maybe you need to change something, or you need a little room?

Was it the simple things that made people crazy about this business? Remember, I have a PDF with secret combinations to play on words.

## How Long Before You Realise You Were Wrong?

You're walking down Baker Street in London. Your head is light, but your feet are dead. Another crazy day: you drink the night away, and you try to forget. Jesus would tell you to forgive, and maybe Bill Withers will comfort you: we all have our own confusion.

Is the grass really greener on other blogs, or is it just a problem-solving matter?

Lately, I was having a look at the Wikipedia entry on problem-solving. It was rather exciting, and they were mentioning several methods to find solutions to troubles and pressure.

There is one method I liked called PROOF: try to prove the problem is unsolvable and when you find it's not, you start to investigate from this point. Recently, I was wondering why I didn't have members on my blog (subscribers that have access to premium content).

Then I decided to offer free membership for the first 200 subscribers. In 3 months, the community of this blog will start to thrive.

## Will It Take 6 Months Maximum Like A Sunspot?

Lately, I was blogging about Bibi Metayahoo. I imagined our leaders as if they were the sun, which experiences dark spots. Those periods of awful cold can last a maximum of 6 months, and that's good news.

So how come my heartaches lasted almost 26 years? That's because there was at least a double crucifixion. I'm not Jesus, who experienced the heavy cross around 33. I was crucified at least twice at 14. You could say it's because of the mud and I need a fancy partner like a horse or a car.

26 years is a long time, and maybe I didn't forget my crime. I'm a long-time investigator, and I'm serving my time. If we hadn't won, I would have been disgusted!
