Readers of that blog know several persons haunt me. A friend, an uncle from my mother, and other people: it's hard to deny there's a kind of war going on. Sometimes it's difficult to see the war: East vs. West or Man against Man?

One thing is sure, though: your allies will be critical to winning the war.

To be bright and exciting, the main subject of that post is the following: are people dying because they feel they lost a battle in a war that's hard to understand? For example, when I was attacked by a friend consistently during the 1st decade of the 21st century, what was it all about?

I guess it was about social and limbic elevation. Otis Redding wasn't helping me, so I decided to listen to all albums by Led Zeppelin. There's a song by Led Zep I do like that most people during the Lebanese Civil War will relate to.

Let's try to understand the wars of the past and the future and see what battles are coming. Let's start with the Lebanese Civil War.

## Was There A Path You Should Not Take?

My mother once told me Lybians were having a party on the rooftops of Beirut. They were shooting civilians, and maybe they were jealous of the point of view we had at the top of these buildings. The truth might ring a bell with the cowards: shooting civilians from rooftops was a risk-free gamble, and that's why they did it.

A world without war could emerge, then if we manage to make wars insanely expensive. Developed countries understood this concept and decided the atomic bomb will be the key to prevent conflicts.

When you think about it, it makes sense: if the price for pissing you off is high, you won't have to face strange games and funky things. Is begging for mercy a sign of weakness then?

## Will The Sun Light This Crime Scene?

Deterrence theory is the idea that an inferior force, by virtue of the destructive power of the force's weapons, could deter a more powerful adversary, provided that this force could be protected against destruction by a surprise attack.

This doctrine gained increased prominence as a military strategy during the Cold War with regard to the use of nuclear weapons and is related to, but distinct from, the concept of Mutual assured destruction, which models the preventative nature of the full-scale nuclear attack that would devastate both parties in a nuclear war.

Instead of begging for mercy, people decided that the phantom of devastating weapons (in case there's a problem) will be the cure. I thought to love, or justice could be the cure, but many people disappeared during the Civil War.

Begging for mercy is for the sick or weak, and we might as well tell everybody to "stop fooling around." What if those wars were due to the devil mocking your every step?

## Will You Let The Bad Luck In?

There's a song I like mentioning a banana skin: if you laugh at somebody, you will let the bad luck in. The more I think about it, the more I think it makes sense: when I was young, following a witchcraft incident when I was 14yo, I decided to be polite. Since that moment I was lucky and wasn't afraid of flying in airplanes or skiing in the mountain alone.

But again, if people died, was it because they felt they lost a battle and didn't want to go to the enemy? I have a Lebanese friend who married a Jew. This blog uses notifications from an Israeli company. And I know the BRICS were very active in Lebanon during the 1st decade of the 21st century.

You shouldn't laugh at anybody even if democracies like to caricature their presidential candidates. But I think I know why people die or have the blues.

## Will Revenge Surely Come?

All in all, let's remember that, from a statistical point of view, revenge will surely come. It means that, if you start a war, you must prepare right now for revenge. And that might be why sometimes some wars seem stupid like the one in Algeria. In the 19th century, France started a war with Algeria because one diplomat slapped another one with a fly swatter.

Lately, someone hinted to me that, in Lebanon, you could start a war quickly with some strange words.

People might die because they lost a battle in a war they weren't prepared for. Take, for example, the 2 superpowers of the 20th century: the USA and Russia. Revenge will surely come and the delicacy of Putin is felt all over the world today. Americans are afraid Donald Trump is a Russian puppet, but I guess it's the future of humanity.

The fundamentals of memory are association (thinking of Lionel Richie makes you think about your previous job). But memory is also a matter of reconstruction, and only the ones courageous enough will remember that not to be a Russian puppet, you must choose your associates carefully.

Auguste Comte used to say, "the dead govern the living." But I think the dead and their associations are just a matter of a sweet conclusion: peace on Earth, end of war and space exploration.
