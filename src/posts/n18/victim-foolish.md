Please, please. When you get back on your feet again, everybody wants to be your long lost friend.

If, like me, being disgusted with life happens to you sometimes, just remember people want to shine. I guess it's hard to do so when in the daylight. So you have to be surrounded by darkness if you want to shine. Thanks to life, it's common.

But don't be a victim. It's always the same old game: people want to shine. And sometimes there is collateral damage. I know it sucks. If, like me, you couldn't sleep at age 3 because of bombardments, then you know life is not a joke.

Life is more like a school where the teacher is often severe and cruel. That's how the school of life is. If, like me, one thing you learned is the importance of respect, then show me some love and leave a comment.

## What Kind Of Fool Are We, You And Me?

Only a fool would jump a second time. Some might even say that only fools rush in.

See, people want to shine. That's the kind of game life is even though it's a serious one. The greatest soccer player ever, Zinedine Zidane, was saying on TV that his friends were as talented as him when he was young. But he was the only one to be serious about it.

I guess if you want to shine you have to be serious. Because love is too mysterious to be reliable. If love is a positive state of mind, you know how hard it is sometimes to see the light surrounding you.

A strong foundation is essential to succeed. Don't be victim of a foolish heart. Tim Duncan was called 'Mr Fundamentals'. And he ended up winning several NBA championships for the San Antonio Spurs. The angle is easy: make an effort to be serious.

## Do You Stare At The Palm Of Your Hands?

Yeah, we are all looking for clues. So if you're in the dark, let your heart lead the way.

For example, right now, my heart tells me I need to clarify things in my life. I was standing, caught in the crossfire of the war on terror initiated by George W. Bush. Even though one could feel privileged to have taken part in a war and won, it came at a price.

My heart tells me the basis of my life is war, extreme and intense violence and aggression. Life is so strange sometimes but I guess when the fog of war invades your head, you can safely bet intense emotions have got a hold on you.

Intense emotions are complex. For example, I'm experiencing rage at the moment and it seems it's because of the sadness linked to survivor guilt and being a genius misunderstood. Do I have to die to sell a record?

## Can You Be A Victim All Of Your Life?

Same ol', same ol'. Play the game. People want to shine. And people judge you by the company you keep. That's why somebody blocked me on Twitter even though I never spoke to that person.

Don't be a victim. If the main entrance is closed, try to enter by the backdoor.

Something simple is the key. I don't know why I'm still on the case. It's a ravenous town. People have needs like electricity in Lebanon and the government has failed to provide it several hours a day. What we gonna do right here is go way back in this country.

I think people are obsessed with finding love or having a positive attitude. But all they can see is red. I know it's hard sometimes to see the light surrounding you. But again a strong foundation is also important.

## Is Watching The News A New Safe Bet?

All in all, how about some information please? Do you want to love forever? I guess it's the goal of everybody here. What if there was one person right for everybody down here?

The safe bet I'm talking about is that when the lesson isn't clear, you can be sure of one thing: information is critical. For example, sometimes during my life, I heard people tell me that I will grow to 6 foot 1 inch tall. I was wondering how that could be possible since I'm 42.

But it seems that people experiencing rage can realise a physical prowess.

The angle is simple if you want to win: find a way to gather information. I'm trying to get into people's head to understand them better. I know they want to shine, that's for sure.
