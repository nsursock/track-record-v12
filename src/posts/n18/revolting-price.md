This post is about love, intensity, and the price to pay. But it might also be about power and political science. One thing is sure though: it's about who will pay the price in case there's a problem.

Take, for example, Lebanon's prime minister, who became a sugar daddy for an Australian swimsuit model. Hariri gave 16 million dollars to this model as a gift. Thus it's not taxable.

While a swimsuit model finally made it through the grapevine, someone owes me 25 million dollars, and I'm still waiting to see them. The clock is ticking for me: I'm 39 years old, almost got married but didn't at 24.

That's why I'm tired of paying the price, and I'm considering making a picture almost naked with a fig leaf. I'm so tired of paying those dues and maybe if I stop moaning they will give me the money.

Who will come and bring you relief because of all the troubles you've seen? Let's try to understand what power is and imagine an easy way to take it back.

## Hopefully, Power Is Trusting Your Awesome World.

They managed to create schools to understand how to take power back. A basic warrior approach would be to spot a weak point in your enemy or theory (or anything) and focus on that. For example, my weak point at the moment is simple: I'm trying to control all the drugs I take, and my accountant is becoming crazy.

But what's the best way to measure power or get reliable information? You'd better use your senses and have a point of view on coincidence.

The Sixth Sense is a 1999 American supernatural horror drama film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. The film tells the story of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a boy who can see and talk to the dead, and Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), a child psychologist who tries to help him. The film established Shyamalan as a writer and director. It introduced the cinema public to his traits, most notably his affinity for surprise endings.

Our senses are the best when it comes to taking power because we get reliable information. But is there a bad way to take power back?

## There's One Surprising Popular Way To Take Power.

![woman sleeping on brown armchair](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535365751156-45e3b6060cc8?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

We all fell ill one day. Maybe you suffer from malaria and see spies everywhere. Maybe you forgot everything you learned. Maybe there's misinformation on every corner. But there's one way to take power back that everyone (even little children) experienced: it's falling ill.

It might not surprise some people that falling ill is a way to have control. I've been ill for a long time now, and it seems it's a perverse way to have control. I guess you could become an eccentric creative person than otherwise. You might be psychotic.

Falling ill is a surprisingly popular way to take power (especially when you are young). In a previous post, I was explaining what the reasons behind those power struggles were.

## Devastated Now You Can't Climb The Stairs For Free.

What if you woke up one morning and you couldn't climb the stairs? It's something you were doing when you were 10 years old efficiently. I guess then those power struggles arise because of some regression.

Regression, according to psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, is a defense mechanism leading to the temporary or long-term reversion of the ego to an earlier stage of development rather than handling unacceptable impulses more adaptively. The defense mechanism of regression, in psychoanalytic theory, occurs when an individual's personality reverts to an earlier stage of development, adopting more childish mannerisms.

Is it the 21st century, or do we need another savior like 2000 years ago? Now I can't go to France without thinking of all the violations I witnessed. They even said I was the brain behind the 2015 terrorist attacks.

The reason behind taking power back might be about regression. I guess we will have to know now who will pay the price this year.

## Are Choices A Frustrating Burden With Decision Making?

![white red and green wooden street sign](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1600074169098-16a54d791d0d?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

Hesitation is your worst enemy when it comes to power, governance, and decision making. I guess it's nice to have a choice, even if it means giving up something. But what if choices were there to underline your capacity to judge?

When it comes to judging, it's always the same old story: there are many things to take into account, but the judge is always right. If the judge thinks 2+2=5, then he/she is right. And that's how science became so popular: who wasn't the witness of bad judgment in his/her short life?

I guess you will have a good judgment when the rain is gone. Dry your eyes, it can't be that bad. Watch all your problems fall like dominoes with the right decisions. 

And don't forget sometimes there are horrors lurking. Don't forget to laugh.
