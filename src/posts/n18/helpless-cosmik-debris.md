This post was inspired by an event that happened to me in 2002 when I was 22 years old. I was about to leave university but couldn't decide if I wanted to pursue a music career. Music was fascinating to me with all the emotions she made me discover.

I was meeting friends of friends and mentioned the fact that I had to see my music teacher soon. One of the acquaintances then erupted like a comet and said: "haha! you still have the same professor?"

Cosmic debris shouldn't be something we're afraid of. It can teach us a lot if we try to understand what's at stake exactly. The acquaintance was a business student. He might have thought about customer lifetime value and how my teacher managed to keep me.

I guess cosmic debris can teach us a lot about space, love, and ruin. That's where knowledge will come to light the room.

## Scarred For Life With Decoding: What Compensation?

This cosmic debris kind of ruined my life. I didn't understand that my acquaintance was talking about customer lifetime value. In marketing, customer lifetime value is a prediction of the net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer.

The prediction model can have varying levels of sophistication and accuracy, ranging from a crude heuristic to the use of sophisticated predictive analytics techniques.

My reaction at the time was to phone my music coach and tell him I wanted to stop. I didn't know why I was doing this because we were having a good time and were doing a good job.

The cosmic debris of my acquaintance could have been an illumination. His teachers were giving him information; he realized that lifetime value was important and identified me as a cash cow.

## Is There A Way To Avoid Cosmik Debris?

If I had a business friend explaining to me that the lifetime value of a relationship is important, I would have thought twice before ending the relationship with my music coach. A few years after, I called him back, and we started to work together again.

But how do you measure the lifetime value of a relationship before you can predict something? Now I have 250 friends, maybe more without noticing, and I wonder what I can do for them.

I know what you think: if cosmic debris are so dangerous, we should avoid them. And I came up with 2 strategies to avoid cosmic debris making you haunt the city for information:
 1. try to adapt to your environment even if the impact was felt,
 2. try to find friends to debrief the cosmic debris.

There are 2 ways to avoid cosmic debris and their crater: adaptation and debriefing. Now we can try to predict the value of having 250 friends.

## Will You Give Thanks More Frequently Now?

Lately, I sent an email to 5 friends from university. Those were guys that had a passion for music like me, and we became friends that way. I was thanking one of the guys for the song I featured in this post ("Real Fonky Time" by Dax Riders).

Cosmik debris can be funky to handle. Look at the moon and all the craters on its surface. Women might have faced many comets if you think a little.

I guess one way you can manage cosmic debris is by giving thanks, being clear, and exciting. When I thanked my friends, one of my friends replied and shared the songs he was listening to at the moment.

Let's remember that Jupiter is deviating much debris so that Earth is safe, and we have to thank this gas giant. What if astronomers had to be more precise about the miracle life?

## Miracle Needs Gas Giants To Make Life Tolerable.

As a conclusion, we need to adapt to change and surround ourselves with skilled people. Why is that? Because a crater on your planet like a crater on your face is disturbing.

You know what I'm talking about: vulgar people always trying to come up with the next equation of the future like me. Maybe vulgarity is not so bad after all; the real problem might be vocabulary then.

Readers of that blog noticed I tend to digress. And I will get back to my point: it's not enough to be at the right distance of a star to make life possible. You should also make sure there's a gas giant like Jupiter protecting you from profound impact events like when video killed the radio star.

Jupiter was deemed a failed star by some astronomers, by the way. So make sure to meet people who have failed (LOL).

By the way, the radio is still alive, and so does television. Explaining things to children can be difficult sometimes, and you could come up with vulgarity and misleading simplification. We need knowledge and adaptation to survive.

Predicting the value of a relationship is an interesting problem. I will stick with my point of view on the matter: rarely disappointed (standard of performance). Schopenhauer used to say that "we might have been too demanding, and this is why we are always disappointed."
