Dignity is the right of a person to be valued and respected for their own sake and to be treated ethically. It is of significance in morality, ethics, law, and politics as an extension of the Enlightenment-era concepts of inherent, inalienable rights.

The term may also be used to describe personal conduct, as in "behaving with dignity." But another definition is used in particular in the field of bioethics.

It refers to a quality that would be linked to the very essence of every human being. It would explain why it is the same for all and which it does not admit any degree. According to the philosopher Paul Ric≈ìur, this notion refers to the idea that "something is due to the human being because he is human."

## Do We Owe A Breakthrough To The French Revolution?

If we follow the definition of Ricoeur, this means we owe something to everybody. Do we, Millenials, owe something to the French revolution? Maybe we owe the French revolution something called the right to make a mistake.

In 1789, they decided to worship reason: they called the Cult of Reason. One year later, they decided to change and worship a Supreme Being. We can see right away how this revolution was doomed.

According to Dire Straits, when you find the reason, you can't get used to it. Jealousy is always a safe bet.

## Is There Something Colossal We Owe To Megadeth?

For all of you who love detective stories, beware. Or all of you who have to investigate a little an incident like coronavirus, this is a warning: the more you inspect, the more you will see yourself reflected.

My advice if you have to conduct a little investigation is to always bring with you a nondistorting mirror. Or maybe one that can make you look good if you're ugly.

## Who Will Pay The Astonishing Debt Of Our Time?

There's a band I like who wrote a song with only one sentence: who will pay the debt of our time? Recently, I met a Syrian who told me to keep calm if my music blog has a hard time with visitors. He told me we lived in a bizarre era.

We owe something to people, and people owe us something. And that may be why crime is increasing and trigger happy police officers came to the spotlight.

Dear reader, I owe you some love. But I have one condition: remember I accept donations if my other offers don't ring a bell.

## What Happens If You Push The Famous Button?

![power switches on wall](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559834384-6a9ab0797727?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

There must be a reason why we choose presidents with care. If your country is a great power, the president has the power to annihilate a whole city by pushing a red button. The atomic age is a surprising one.

But if you have a basic knowledge of humanity, then everybody knows there are buttons you shouldn't push. Today I watched a humorous sketch by Guy Bedos. He mentioned in passing that Lebanese men are horrible.

## Is The Concept Of Debt Central In Human Societies?

![man walking beside graffiti](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493837129895-61062b2444f7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

Debts play a central role in the organization of human activities, particularly economic ones. Generally, a debt allows an investment that must improve production. Musicians know how important a good producer is.

I wrote several songs for 20 years and finalized around five. I'm almost close to getting an EP out. And now I have to find a producer.

I have a production problem because the sound of drums in LogicPro and GarageBand are realistic. Other instruments sound like they come from a video game, however. What if the concept of debt was about contrast and how your expectations can be high?

## Do You Have A Hard Time Getting Used To It?

All in all, I hope I opened your eyes today: we owe each other something. My music software owes an explanation to me: why do I have to work on the sound of all instruments except drums? Wasn't it possible to have the same quality for all instruments?

Yes, dear reader, everybody has to make an effort. Mostly during that corona crisis where the aura makes everybody ill. An aura is a distinctive and pervasive quality or character (ie, air, atmosphere).

I don't know if you would have liked the atmosphere since 2001. Every home was like Alcatraz, and mother fuckers lost their mind. On the apartment's parquet, the grass was growing thick. And the music was awful.

I guess we know the root cause of all this mess: just when we fall in love again, people say that all good things must end.
