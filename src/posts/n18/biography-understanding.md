I Lived and learned from fools and from sages. That lyric from Aerosmith opens up a lot of possibilities, saying that even the weirdest person can teach you something. For example, when I was young, we had someone in our class who used to play xylophone at his window to contact aliens.

Needless to say he had no chance against NASA. He was talking about it with a smile upon his face. We dismissed him as the weirdest person we know. And now I'm almost in his place.

Why you might ask? After several years of investigations using music and free association, I found a code that is supposed to free me. The light at the end of the tunnel? Why not you also?

I had the strangest life since 2001. A weird odyssey you might say. I'm in the middle of a whodunit plot.

## Did My Biggest Hero Die By Vomit Suffocation?

Jimi Hendrix started playing the guitar when he was young. His father offered him one hoping it would help him express himself. When he was in the army he created a band and managed to get out to haunt the United States as a soul musician.

When I was young, I was fascinated by Jimi Hendrix. As the years go by, I started to understand his music more and more. Hendrix had a rough time before changing the rock music world forever.

Hendrix was sleeping at the Samarkand hotel in London in 1970 with his girlfriend. He overdosed on sleeping pills and woke up. He was vomiting but it was going back in his throat and started to asphyxiate him. What an awful death for someone that had gained so much importance.

I don't want to die young. Maybe that's because I had a pretty shitty life since 2001 and I'm not talking about adolescence during the 90s. By the way, depression was so much better during the 90s...

## Did Another Hero Get Ousted From The Company He Created?

I'm a big fan of Steve Jobs. I think we can learn a lot from him. When I was young I wanted an Amiga computer or a PC but my father insisted I use an Apple IIe. See, my father also had founded something and had to leave. So he could relate to Jobs.

Jobs dropped out of college and managed to stay a little to take the classes he wanted like the callygraphy one. That's why today why all computers have fonts and the publishing industry is what it is.

He founded Apple with Steve Wozniak, brought John Sculley to run the company and was ousted. He then founded NeXT which would be later acquired by Apple making Unix the basis of MacOS. Talk about connecting the dots!

Jobs also wandered in the animation industry by buying Pixar which would create the first 3D cartoon movie. Jobs died and his last words were "Oh Wow". After all he had accomplished, he also left us early. Only the good die young.

## Did Another Hero Leave While I Was Standing In The Crossfire?

![brown wooden bench on brown sand during daytime](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1620837953277-985e536c977a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

I was born in Lebanon in 1980, the same day my two grandfathers were born. My maternal grandpa, Joseph Naggear, had had a brilliant career in Lebanon until the start of the Civil War in 1975. He was the first Lebanese graduate of Polytechnique (aka X) in the early 1930s. X is the best engineering school in France.

My grandpa dealt with a lot of missions in Lebanon and was several times appointed minister.

Until 2010, I never thought he would play such a major role in my life. I discovered the solidarity during hard times people from X exhibit. I wasn't a graduate of X but being the grandson of someone who did was enough. Maybe I was showing skills that reminded people of the best.

My grandpa died in 2006 just before the war with Israel. His death became strange because I was just leaving my parents at that time and transitioned to a new flat. If memory is associative, I'll let you guess how painful moving out is for me since then.

## One Thing I Learned Recently By A Successful Artist

![selective focus photography of foot print](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522756890800-ac12d130a43f?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

All in all, those role models play a major role in our comprehending of our lives. They've been there and they can give us great advice about life. For example, the most recent advice I received was simple: Keep exploring.

As time goes by, I want to explore more and more the lives of my heroes, my life and my subconscious.

To avoid moral bankruptcy and atrocities, I want to explore this world and this universe. I believe the 21st century should be the time to focus on space exploration and forget everything of our infighting. Because our survival depends on our unity: Together we stand, divided we fall.

That's why I believe the code I found has the potential to end all wars. We don't need a war for that.
