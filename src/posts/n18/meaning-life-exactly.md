I was going to write about life with a zona but I decided to write about the meaning of life. I already blogged about it saying it was about criticising. But there must be something else about life we're missing and I'm going to take an example based on my life.

This example is very clear: I was about to graduate when I was 22 years old and I had to find an internship. Suddenly I receive anonymous letters and my girlfriend almost stabbed me.

So maybe the game of life is about contrast and expectations. It's also about being positive and suddenly a catastrophe happens. You can call it a black swan: an improbable event like dating a girl in Paris in the year 2002.

Of course, there's a temptation to learn something from this and I must say the lesson is very hard. You'd better take a fool's advice and be egoistic because one day they're here and next day they're gone. Yes I'm talking about loved ones.

## Do You Know Your Uncle Point When You Get A Fever?

There's a point according to Nicholas Nassim Taleb when you stop playing. It's called the UNKL point. I'm not even talking about austerity where you only play AA with a 80% probability to win. I'm talking about quitting.

In a previous post I was talking about obvious things like "you don't wanna play you might as well quit". But here we could try austerity. Is life really a game of poker? What if it was musical instead? After all, music is cheaper than a psychiatrist.

Music is a cruel mistress: you have to practice at home and, during the gig or in the studio, you have to make zero false notes. It's as if the Earth was a big tribe and your smoke signals shouldn't be taken lightly.

If really zero wrong notes seem unreachable to you, you could make believe it's part of the melody or solo. But you have to emphasise the right notes like that time where I graduated or that time where I managed to date a girl in Paris.

## Do You Think It Will Get More Complicated And Aggravated?

![person sitting on cliff above building](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1460639763825-d45267e63cd3?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

When an inner situation is not made conscious, it appears outside as fate. If a problem is not treated correctly, it might get complicated. Aggravation is a cruel mistress. Once people decided I was unable to have a social life because of my limbic brain polluted by a chemotherapy.

One should not aggravate a problem and this is a basic fundamental of medicine: first do no harm and then heal. The fact a cigarette reminds me of a chemotherapy makes me smoke 4 packs a day now. I know I'm a hypocrite.

My method to quit smoking is simple: you should get bored of it. What's the use of a 5 minute break in a busy day? Is it so wrong to dream 5 minutes? What should I do with my days and nights?

The climate is awful: we're thinking every day about people who died. What's the secret of death?

## Jokes Create A Surprising Space Bigger Than Love.

Woman that laughs is halfway in your bed. This French saying could help me understand what's so funny about joking.

Humour (British English), also spelt as humor (American English), is the tendency of experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement. The term derives from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks, which taught that the balance of fluids in the human body, known as humours (Latin: humor, "body fluid"), controlled human health and emotion.

The word is out: you want to have fun. Again this could mean you want to be solid and strong because you know life can create some awful moments sometimes.

Audacity has taken over. As a writer, it seems it's a good thing. But for schools it seems audacity is a bad thing. I guess someone will pay for the crashed car but I wonder who.

## You Misread The Meaning But Thank God He Woke Up.

As a conclusion, the meaning of life is of course debatable but I do think contrast, severity, austerity and complications are important aspects of everyone's life. Of course we're here to win but there must be a price to pay.

Lately I was thinking that luck was about killing costs. What if it doesn't cost me anything to tell my family "go fuck yourself"? What if it doesn't cost me anything to tell my school friends "go fuck yourself"? You know for the people you knew in the first 18 years of your life, you might want to die.

Anyway let's remember that rape and murder is just a shot away. When you are 12 years old and someone tells you you're a jerk (stupid, naive and unreachable), you know there's something wrong with the world. In the past, they could tell if someone was worthy by the color of the skin.

Today the rules have changed and skin color is out of the game. I wonder what will be out of the game in the future? Maybe they will say that people who don't smile have the right to do it and is no sign of mental illness.
