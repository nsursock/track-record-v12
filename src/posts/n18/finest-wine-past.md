Iran also called Persia and officially known as the Islamic Republic of Iran, is a country in Western Asia. With 82 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 18th most populous country. Its territory spans 1,648,195 square kilometers (636,372 square miles), making it the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 17th largest in the world.

Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations. But today, I want to say something: Last time Iran was sober, man, they felt terrible.

For example, Iran decided there were two Satans on Earth:
  1. The first Satan is, of course, the United States. They call America the Big Satan,
  2. The second Satan is, of course, Russia and, by extension, the BRICS. They call Russia the Lesser Satan.

It's no wonder Iran demonstrated its will to acquire nuclear weapons like a Great Power. It's no wonder Europeans must appreciate a country that decided to combat their rivals.

But once again, last time Iran was sober, we could go on holiday. Declaring war on half of humanity (the BRICS) and the first high power of the world (USA) might be a risky bet.

## As A Result, Their Lives Might Make Perfect Sense!

What can be the daily bread of a country clearly declaring war on big nations? I guess there's no mistake: lust and food and violence and sex and money and dirty tricks.

I worked with Iranians and Zoroastrians, and I must say the job resembled brutal death technical jobs. Freddie Mercury was a flamboyant Zoroastrian, but he didn't declare war on Russia and America.

I guess the Islamic revolution must have done something to the country. Islam is a religion that is preoccupied with conquests. The problem is that afterward, you have to manage the long run.

Don't get me wrong; we all like Iran's history, but it's as if I were declaring war on Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton.

## What Can Be The Role Of Iranian Women?

Iranian women must be strong; I think it's a basic fact we can't deny. But like most human beings, I think they can sometimes display a little hesitation about some basic subjects like marriage.

Being Lebanese, I have a particular relationship with Iran. Plus, I worked in France for five years between 2005 and 2010, and the workplace was filled with people from different horizons.

I guess marriage is a dodgy subject in all countries in the world, like the subject of UFOs or space people. Yesterday I was watching a documentary on space, and the astronauts were saying that, from the space station, it's clear we are all under the same sun.

It means we should unite the planet around a project. Mercury was talking about Mother Nature doing a miracle: peace and end of the war.

## The Past Can Be A Blessing And A Curse.

It's a winter that never ends. A glorious past the future generations must nurture, and they will get drunk with that demanding brew. Don't expect Iran to behave correctly and wear a sunny smile.

Lately, America managed to kill a revered military general in Iran.

I sometimes wonder if someone will remember me as a man of peace after being central in participating in WW3 between 2001 and 2010. Nobody talks about it, and, as a result, I can't have a Wikipedia page. So please nicely talk about me! ðŸ™‚

Of course, you can do like me and explain why Iran can't be sober clearly mentioning their enemies. But again, if you're sober, you might lose consciousness.

This is my point of view on Iran and history: last time we were sober, man we felt terrible! So to all of you who want to experience vodka or rum, remember you can read a history book.

## Should You Beware Of Those Who Peak Too Early?

To conclude, of course, if you're sober, you might lose consciousness. And that may be why Iran declared war on Russia and the USA. I'm French and Lebanese, and now I don't know who my competitors are.

I'm a blogger, so I guess my competitors are other bloggers. But I also try to be a man, and I always end up in the same old jam: I don't seem to care.

Will I lose another friend by whispering on the Internet? Only time will tell. Watch out for the next episode. It's no wonder that declaring war to the rest of the world is a risky bet. But I guess the one who drives should be sober.

Beautiful women and healthy people will bring everyone to their rightful place. Maybe astronomy can also play that role: billions of galaxies are made of billions of stars. The lesson of astronomy is simple: the more information we get, the more we realize that love is getting deeper.
