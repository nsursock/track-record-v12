title: "Do You Feel Like Good Things In Life Are So Few?"

There's a particular time in everyone's life called childhood. Bad things in life are usually few during that period. There's also a specific time when you can have good luck, and it sometimes disappears. One day you wake up, and bad luck doesn't want to go away anymore.

When that happens, it's because someone owes you big money and is late making a payment. As a skilled negotiator, remember that you should enter a negotiation in a position of power. You can fake a power pose if that makes you feel better, or do some yoga and stretching.

If you want to have luck, my method is to find a hidden meaning in words: you have to kill costs, but you also need to spend less time in cheap hotels. Bring your alibis like a James Brown lyric: I'm a sex machine, and I'm staying on the sin.

## What If We Made The Human Blue Note Official?

It's time to make official the human blue note. Christians used to call that the original sin. We ate fruit and became conscious and intelligent. But I'm not so sure this is the right sin.

Maybe our sin of hubris was manifest: we had problems concentrating and felt sorry. But it wasn't enough. Now the universe exploded because of one man's lie, and we've been drifting with sexy music for 14 billion years.

The more I think about it, the more I think our blue note is simple: INVADERS. With them, we are obliged to be vigilant all day and all night. It's exhausting, and we must have a temple where we can rest our bones. We have to imagine an atrocity, such as bombings (as in World War II or the Lebanese Civil War).

## Do You Have An Innate Sense Of Wellness?

When I was a child, I had an innate sense of life and its mysteries. I spent time in an exciting environment. Mother Nature is, of course, a wonderful woman. But what about space travel and Mother Space?

Now with gravitational waves, we can listen to the cosmos. It's incredible because there is no air in space. Sounds exist because of the vibration of air. But it seems the essential factor is pressure.

The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases, commonly known as air, that surrounds the planet Earth and is retained by Earth's gravity. The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation).

By volume, dry air contains 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases.

## Is Pressure The Most Important Factor?

When I drive a car, I have pressure to drive safely; otherwise, someone will go down. I also hesitate when it comes to crashing the car in a tree. And that's where we have to be vigilant with life.

In real life, kissing a tree is acceptable. And that may be why people die of cancer and self-destruction. The other hint I have is, of course, someone that will end 7 years of good luck and turn all the songs into a circus.

With the right pressure, we can start to live again. Now we can see the right atmosphere is composed of something that could be dynamite: you have to be neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic. You have to have the right concentration as if you're driving a car, and there is no crisis.

## When In Doubt I Guess It's Wise To Be Extreme.

In closing, if being neither under nor overvalued is dynamite, it makes sense to find an extreme when in doubt. Childhood can be a temple where bad things in life are so few. It's so beautiful to feel healthy and up for any challenge. Of course, some factors are difficult to control, like age.

But what if we found a way not to lose our head with so much stimulation and so many tribes still haunting the city. There's one thing fundamental for life, and it's our atmosphere. 80% of that atmosphere is nitrogen.

This atmosphere could also mean we're going into overtime, and we're almost there. Space travel and billions of stars and galaxies are waiting for us. Maybe billions of universe.

As you know, I found the crucial hint that is supposed to free humanity. It can mean several things, but another possibility is bones. Sometimes, I like to think of bones like a lifebuoy.
