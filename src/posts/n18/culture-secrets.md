Today I'm going to reveal a secret I told nobody before. It's a creative method that allowed me to make sense of two simple things: why Iran's Mohammad Mosaddeq was appointed prime minister and why do our stars shine in a violent universe.

I know it might make you a little bit skeptical, but again this is business as usual to most of us. My goal is to make you more trustful: we live in a gigantic allusion that we need to decode.

My job as an artist (aka as an inventive and eccentric person) is to bring you to hell with me. But I also have to show you a way out. Creativity and culture allow you to connect dots and, as if you were listening to a song, they talk to your senses.

Let me take you to hell, and you will appreciate your life more. We're going to study two allusions encoded with the same algorithm.

## Did You Get Disgusted Of The Hyperactive Boredom?

Mohammad Mosaddeq (1882 – 1967) was an Iranian politician who served as the 35th Prime Minister of Iran, holding office from 1951 until 1953, when his government was overthrown in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état orchestrated by the United States' Central Intelligence Agency and the United Kingdom's MI6.

An author, administrator, lawyer, and prominent parliamentarian, his administration introduced a range of social and political measures such as social security, land reforms, and higher taxes.

You know how Iran and Israel became worst enemies. To the point that we had a world war since 2001. You know the Mossad, don't you?

Mossad is the national intelligence agency of Israel. It is one of the chief entities in the Israeli Intelligence Community, along with Aman (military intelligence) and Shin Bet (internal security). Mossad is responsible for intelligence collection, covert operations, and counterterrorism.

Now thanks to my French and English culture, I'm able to find an imaginative meaning with Mossadegh and even the Mossad. Mossadegh might have been disgusted by Israel ("degh" in French slang is short for "disgusted"). And Mossad in French can also mean that it inspires boredom. If you're down on your luck lately, then look no further: it might be a special operation by secret service.

Learn to embrace those simple allusions that life has handed you. And now let's check the other troubling coincidence about our star.

## Will Wicked Violence Rule Your Little World?

If I do the same kind of dot-connecting work with a U2 song called "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)," you can get the confirmation that we need to decode our universe. And we need to find the encoder. Rest assured, the algorithm isn't MPEG-1 layer 3 (aka MP3), but it might exploit some basic tricks the mind knows nothing about yet!

Life is possible because of a star and being at the right distance of this stellar object where liquid water exists (neither too hot nor too cold). If we reason as we did before with Mossadeq, it means our star is the result of extreme violence. In French, it could mean raped to death and maybe beyond. It means literally "ultraraped."

Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person's consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability, or is below the legal age of consent. The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault.

Worldwide, sexual violence, including rape, is primarily committed by males against females.

## Is Our Crazy Universe About Consent Surprisingly?

All in all, if we decode that U2's song and we go further in analyzing what our universe is all about, it might be about consent. Maybe consent is the world's oldest problem that sex workers tried to solve. I know a sociologist who gave up, and she became a pro moaner.

Today I'm giving my 50 cents on the subject. Watch out for inflation!

I never gave too much thought about consent during my life. I was too busy trying to do the right thing in all areas of my life. If politics is only about power struggles, then this could explain why consent is such a touchy subject.

Even if you give your approval today, you might discover later that your love partner is doing sexual tourism in places where children are forced to work early. But please, keep calm and relax because, if you don't find the words like "I do," your body will speak volumes.

Consent might be the principal problem of our universe. When this is over, say hello to spring, and five more days until summer (takes me away).
