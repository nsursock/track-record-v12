Casting some doubt about human certitudes is opening the door to discoveries (Faraday). I guess science can't help but wonder if everything we see or hear is true or not. Nothing is more profitable to progress than distinguishing our certitudes from our ignorance (Bernard).

In a previous post, I was quoting Yngwie Malmsteen's apathy: he was saying that too many uniforms were trying to run the show. And he may be right!

Anyway, that's why sometimes I open a magazine and let my mind wander. Today I'm going to talk about random subjects found in a special issue of French newspaper "Le Monde".

Let's talk for example about Toussaint Louverture: in 1791, in Haiti, he was fighting for Black people's dignity. Dignity is the idea that you owe something to people because they are human. That's where being a robot comes handy. If you're tired of dressing up correctly to go have a coffee, embrace being a robot.

## Yes We Can Can If We Want Want.

François-Dominique Toussaint Louverture (20 May 1743 – 7 April 1803), also known as Toussaint L'Ouverture or Toussaint Bréda, was a French general and best-known leader of the Haitian Revolution. He was a leader of the growing resistance.

His military and political acumen saved the gains of the first black insurrection in November 1791.

He first fought for the Spanish against the French; then for France against Spain and Great Britain; and finally, he fought on behalf of Saint-Domingue in the era of Napoleonic France. He helped transform the slave insurgency into a revolutionary movement.

Again a crime against humanity transforms into a revolution: why make the same mistakes than in the past? Was it solely to make fun of history and our glorious predecessors?

When there's a will there's a way. But watch out for the wall: an excellent education that you have to get out of quickly if you want to survive. We can see how Toussaint's path seem plagued by strange alliances (fighting the French and then joining them).

## Why Is Death Better Than Obscurantism?

![purple and yellow abstract painting](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1610337673044-720471f83677?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

In 1600, in Italy, Giordano Bruno prefers death to obscurantism. Obscurantism is the practice of deliberately presenting information in an imprecise and recondite manner, often designed to forestall further inquiry and understanding.

It's strange Bruno preferred death to obscurantism because it clearly is about a sacred knowledge and barrier to entry. Take for example The Police's song mentioned in this post: "giant steps: I hope my legs won't break walking on the moon".

This line clearly explains he's dizzy about women and he hopes his legs and knees will still be here after the rumination. Obscurantism might be about knowledge but you clearly want the recipient to make an extra effort because the diagnostic is obvious.

There are two historical and intellectual denotations of Obscurantism: 
  1. the deliberate restriction of knowledge—opposition to disseminating knowledge; and, 
  2. deliberate obscurity—an abstruse style (as in literature and art) characterized by deliberate vagueness.

## An Apple A Day Reminds You Of The Original Sin.

7th century BC, Adam and Eve disobey God. Original sin, also called ancestral sin, is a Christian belief in the state of sin in which humanity has existed since the fall of man, stemming from Adam and Eve's rebellion in Eden, namely the sin of disobedience in consuming the forbidden fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

This condition has been characterized in many ways, ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a "sin nature", to something as drastic as total depravity or automatic guilt of all humans through collective guilt.

Maybe your sin is to think differently or be slightly different than others. See we have standards here on Earth. I guess then it's normal we feel confused even though we start to understand that black ocean separating stars.

## Why Not Make Conscious Your Inner Situation?

![grayscale photo of man](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1500653504950-5a0179eeea8b?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

8th century BC: the Oedipus myth marks the refusal of destiny. Destiny, sometimes referred to as fate (from Latin fatum "decree, prediction, destiny, fate"), is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual.

When an inner situation is not made conscious, it appears outside as fate. I guess if your destiny makes you rich and healthy, then there is no need to make it conscious and you just have to ride the wave. But what if your destiny was to live your life alone and leaving your dreams at the doorway of someone?

The Oedipus complex (also spelled Œdipus complex) is a concept of psychoanalytic theory. Sigmund Freud introduced the concept in his Interpretation of Dreams (1899).

The positive Oedipus complex refers to a child's unconscious sexual desire for the opposite-sex parent and hatred for the same-sex parent. The negative Oedipus complex refers to a child's unconscious sexual desire for the same-sex parent and hatred for the opposite-sex parent. Freud considered that the child's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful outcome of the complex.

According to Freud, this is the central complex that will guide us all our lives. So make sure to resolve this quickly!
