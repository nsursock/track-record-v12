I'm going to write today as if I don't care. I will try to mimic a scene from the French humorists Les Inconnus. In that scene, they depicted a Romanian painter and refugee. He was creating artwork with bird droppings, but I won't go as far today.

I will try to explain my creative process for writing a post. Most of the time, it will be based on something I had learned and be about a time when my musical culture gave me an illumination.

For example, I once read in a medical book that knees were important. It's where the conscious and subconscious meet. Of course, you could also talk about elbows. What's interesting is that the lower part of the body is dealing with the gravity of the planet.

Suddenly, I go through my record collection and find several songs talking about knees. It seems the doctor's book was right: if you take care of your knees, everything will be fine. He even mentioned how in French, the word "knee" (genou) could mean "you and me."

For my creative process, I also dig deep into the past for things that make me angry and nervous. I could say there's no crisis, summon my inner bitch and go back to my old tricks. But I'm tired of scratching this itch all day long. My creative process also is possible thanks to listening to music.

## Is A Strong Work Ethic The Last Chance To Succeed?

My music coach used to tell me that "talent without work is only manic depression." Depression is for bored people with clouds over their heads. Today, I'm wearing a gray top with a gray jacket, and I thought, why should I get angry at clouds?

I'm a Mediterranean person (I was born in Beirut, Lebanon). I like the sun more than music sometimes. What I mean is that I might be concerned about energy and balance. I'm confident that energy, power, and strength come from balance.

I was born on October 5th, and my astrological sign is Libra. Justice is the first subject that matters to me. At the beginning of this blog, I mentioned a French comic called "Valerian and Laureline" (it's science fiction). In the first episode, there's a simple scene: "you have to be the witness of injustice and do nothing."

It's been 7 million years, and the little bug that we used to be is starting to grasp the power of space travel more and more. It might not be much according to a human scale; what if aliens were already battling in the universe?

Little bug: have a heart. Misery isn't our friend. What do you see in insanity? What happened to humanity?

## Can A Bright Perspective On Insanity See The Light?

![focus on eye](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1631881063168-7e49e353db21?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

I never thought about the problem of insanity that much. I worked in banking between 2005 and 2010, and you could call me crazy. It was the time of the worst recession since 1929.

Yesterday I was listening to a Leonard Cohen song. He was talking about severe judgments, party invitations, and much more. He also wrote that we should do something crazyâ€”but to be more precise, something absolutely wrong.

And that may be why insanity is dangerous. If you drove a car, it might push you to crash it into a tree once per week. If you played guitar, it might prevent you from playing quietly during the pianist's solo. If you were a mathematician, then you might say that 2+2=5.

Sometimes insanity is cool: For example, if you had $40,000 in the bank, you could tell the banker that $20,000 + $20,000 = $50,000. That way, you made $10,000 easily with insanity. Again insanity might be a question of profitability. Some doctors used to say that patients profit from their symptoms.

## Would A Huge Gift Be Telling The Truth About Humanity?

![white and black i am a good day print card](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596927553760-00df5b1dfb4f?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

The truth about humanity is that we are hesitating. I vacillate between competition and solidarity. I know Benjamin Metayahoo said that life is simple; it's about competition and nothing more. But what if we were meant for more than this? Did someone from Heaven interfere with the mortal world?

Lately, I had a fantastic thought: Maybe we were robots that had a teenage angst crisis. Now, we do the exact opposite of the program that was uploaded in our heads and hearts.

Maybe humans were sent to work on Earth and make lots of discoveries:
 - exploiting psycho-acoustics to make MP3s,
 - using X-rays to see the bones of someone,
 - discovering teleportation is feasible with good music,
 - finding a good compromise between work and life.

What happened to humanity, exactly? No one knows, except maybe scientists. But what if some dirty mind laid false evidence to mislead us? Some say we originated in Kenya; some say we come from a comet.

One thing is for sure though: It seems that decompression sickness suckered us but not our friends (if we still have some).

## Are Lust And Exuberance The Way Out Of Here?

![woman with red lipstick and red lipstick](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579752515255-40a127455074?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

I have one word about the song I chose today. The song is an effort from 1991 and is called Blood Sugar Sex Magik. It's the fifth studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. The introduction and verses aren't that nice, but the chorus is incredible. Transparent and exciting, it deals with the subject of power and how much time we have until our country will call.

Also, straight from the introduction, it talks about the primary responsibility of humanity, called "rest and digest." It could be the name of a hard rock band, like Guns N' Roses. It also deals with the difficult subjects of finding the right words (at the right time?)

The song mentions politicians caring only about their ambitions. The environment is critical for everybody's wellbeing. It seems the population is guilty during that song. We know our elites must work hard to create jobs. Who wants to be a cashier or a proofreader?

The song closes with the now explicit subjects of insanity and humanity. We have to consider ourselves rich even though our tiny rock seems small in the cosmic concert. What if it didn't cost anything to kill the past? Maybe we could rewrite it a little more so it can send us in space easily and make love affordable.
