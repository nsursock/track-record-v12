Today I want to talk about Christmas and the presents or gifts we receive at that time. But let's talk about Christmas every day then if you have a nice strategy to handle the past and the future.

The song I chose is from Chris Rea on the album "New Light Through Old Windows". I like the name of that album as if the age of the windows didn't matter. What we need is a little light to see some fine things have been laid upon the table.

What if we always want something we can't get like an infinite space or a lasting love or an understandable joke?

Christmas is the time of year where most people receive presents or gifts. Which leads to talk about the past and the future: because now is a special gift or present!

## The One Mistake Ruminating People Do.

There's one mistake I make when I'm bored or melancholic or depressed: I mistake the past for the future. There's a special strategy to handle correctly the past, the present and the future.

When it comes to the future, you should try to look far away. Right now, I'm tired and I'm contemplating the last 2000 years (a pretty long time for humanity). Sometimes I think about that cosmic debris that made the dinosaurs history.

When it comes to the past, you should have a look from time to time. But please don't go back too long ago and dwell on that note. Because our universe is 14 billion years old and there might be several universes.

The present has a nice name to remind you that the time is now. Now you're here and you have an amazing gift to open: don't you wonder what this day will bring?

## In French Time Can Be Mistaken With Climate.

Thanks to my triple culture (French, English and Arabic), I can sometimes reflect on the words we use to name something and reflect on the meanings.

Basically French people are saying that, if you want to master your time, you only have to think of a climate like 300 days of sun a year. I was a bit puzzled by the climate in the Parisian region because it's a curious one with influences from the East.

Being curious is part of what makes us human along with speaking. I have a strange relationship with France mainly because an old lover was stalking them since 1994. What a nice climate: an old lover is stalking you.

The first time my music coach mentioned a climate in my songs, it was on a song I wrote whose chorus was simple: "hey honey, I don't think you've ever loved me; I've been thinking lately".

## Should You Play With The Light For A Nice Picture?

I once read the basis of photography was to play with the light. I never thought about it this way but it makes sense. Sometimes, if you get the right insight, you can find the guitar you left somewhere or that book you have to finish before Christmas.

That's why that blog name is "Sounds Sirius' Music Insights". The Sirius part is a little private joke but the important part is the insight one. A new light when you use common sense: how come the word "present" means gift and now in English?

The past makes you nervous and angry; the future makes you stressed and anxious. The present is synonymous with calm and serenity. That was an advice I read by a sports' coach; a very interesting read that made me conscious.

## Are You Concerned About Your Happiness?

Do you like to count flowers on the wall? Or maybe play solitaire til dawn with a deck of 51? My adolescence was so poor I had to rely strictly on music to have a decent vocabulary. My friends were so stupid when they talked that I decided to be silent most of the time.

Oddly enough, I had some interesting body language since then. It seems, when it comes to communication, what you don't say is more important than what you say.

The present is a gift, the past is like a rear view mirror and the future can only be understood with a horizon (it's where the earth and the sky meet). If you want to have a bright future, I guess you have to fasten your seat belt: it's where your upper and lower body meet!
