Today I want to write about the drugs I take because it seems it can transpire in the music blog. With the right psychotropic substance, you can probably make an excellent piece of art.

But one thing first about what I look like. I have a friendly face always vigilant with eyes wide open. That's because when I was 18, I learned the eyes were the mirror of the soul.

Also, I learned recently that the face could be like your identity. I'm a good musician like many exist, but I have an enormous record collection.

There's one thing though that's a little bit weird at the moment: it's my profile. That's because someone managed to put a spell on me, explaining, "I had no experience." I'm skilled at driving a car, though, and playing the guitar.

And now, let's see what kind of substance abuse can sometimes make my voice sound a little tentative. First, let's remember the central drug everybody knows: age and probabilities.

## Did You See The Darkness Surrounding You?

The first drug is linked to age and probabilities. For example, I never did cocaine in 39 years; but I worked with people taking cocaine, and since I'm an empath, I can feel the effects.

Cocaine is a powerful stimulant, and it has a small accepted medical use, such as numbing. Cocaine can provide you with a stunning breathing experience at the expense of your neighbors, though. Pretending they don't exist can be different from avoiding them.

The cocaine I took indirectly is, of course, a little disturbing. I never had experience with coke except maybe when I drive a car, and there's no crisis: don't kiss a tree with your vehicle.

Life is different from driving a car. But I do believe life is about music and eccentric creations.

## Did I Mention Isotretinoin For A Bad Obsession?

When I was 17, I had the honor to be treated for being exceptionally rude. Since then, I tried to be polite but stumbled upon coworkers saying I was too polite, to be honest. Now I don't know how to behave anymore, and I once again turn to music for guidance.

Are we all teenage dirtbags? Do we all listen to stupid music in secret? Why do we fear so much judgment? Because people don't know shit, and they are severe.

When I was 14 years old, a guardian demon decided to make me a eunuch. I grew up in a girls' school, and it seems I was a danger for them. Thank God it was only a guardian demon because the other kind of fiend in Ancient Egypt is an executioner.

According to music, those demons are your friends and will make you rich. I know sometimes it's not that obvious, but I trust the music.

## Do Cigarettes Help Me Breathe A Little?

They say cigarettes are dangerous. There are lots of cancerogenic substances in a cigarette. Smoking is bad for health! But the more I think about it, the more I think it helps me breathe. And now I smoke 4 packs a day.

I'm 39 years old, and I had my share of dirty experience since 2001. In 2010, bad luck decided to visit me, and I knew this time, it would be hard to say goodbye. 10 years later, bad luck is still there, and I'm tired of this 3rd degree.

I live in Paris, and the cost of living is incredible. If luck is about killing costs, then you know you have to leave this city of blinding lights. Because everyone around you is also unlucky.

## Will Coffee Unite The Planet With Quality Words?

There is another drug I do daily. It's called coffee, and it's one of the most profitable drugs on the planet. Coffee and cigarettes are a deadly combination.

Without coffee shops, my social life could be a little dull. Sometimes friendships fluctuate, and you have to go out of the home to check if there are people alive.

I don't know what people in power did since 2001, but I'm hanging on by a thread. I guess the most fragile people will disappear. If only my friends weren't so selfish.

I was warned a long time ago by a friend: "tell me what I've got to do to make my life mean more to you." Now the family is shattered, and my mother cried all the tears she could.

Some people have no heart, and I must mention another drug I was given in a moment of weakness: olanzapine, also called a neuroleptic. It reminds me of a beautiful person who also had a moment of madness.
