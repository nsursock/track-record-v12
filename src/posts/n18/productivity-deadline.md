You want to be productive. Make a piece of art that will stand out and resist the test of time. For me, the test of time is a test that has 3 synonyms: the test of the complex, the test of the dominant idea and, the test of the shadow.

I could explain in details what I mean but sometimes I like to think my readers understand what is my intention. Everybody knows about the test of time. New York couples still fight about it.

Once a label is on something, it's no longer alive. That's when positive labeling can be a life savior. For example, this blog is for all party people still a bit hungover.

## No Blogging Duty Is Gonna Make Me Crawl

You have to have deadlines. They say time is money. But maybe it's the complex things, the dominant ideas or the shadows at work that can give us money.

When I want to write something on my blog, I start listening to music. Or maybe think of a sentence in a song that I heard. Never thought about climate change.

That's why the climate of that post will be metaphors. The first one I could think of is children and babies. You make love and suddenly you got 9 months during which you will wonder if a child will come to the world.

The deadline is 9 months and I wonder how we came up with that.

Anyway, you still got 18 years to be without too much anxiety and nervousness. Or maybe some of us never had that time. Some of us grow old a bit younger.

## Mission Of Mercy To The New Frontier

![snow covered ground under starry night](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1610963196817-7d1415647029?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

I almost gave up on that blog. I thought that nobody is able to recognize the talent. Although it is based on the music of the last 60 years. Which is based on the music of the last 200 million years?

That's what I liked about the kind of music I listen to. It's suspicious and seductive. Suddenly, I play funky licks that resemble classical music.

I guess the new frontier is 2020. And if I don't make it, I will think of 2035, when Rael will take over the world. Because capitalism and communism have failed.

Or maybe the Aztec and Incas will be back in a special body and the Sun will dance. The moon will show her dark side more often and Jupiter will not protect us anymore from asteroids.

The new frontier is giving thanks it seems.

## They Will Overthink And Make You Feel Bad

![person hesitating in pool](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1656700088034-0a40ccd38601?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

Beginners should not be allowed outside. That might be why the Baiser Sal√© in Paris, France (a French jazz and soul palace) has a jam session for beginners on Sunday. Monday it's for experienced people.

The first time I tried playing there, an Italian pianist whispered before we played: "during my solo, I don't want to hear a sound from you".

And then I started working in the banking industry while I was preparing for my music career. I would go home and start improvising on songs and think I'm a star. Which I was.

In tennis, they say practicing is cool but the goal is to reproduce good behaviors on the court. And your first enemy is yourself. The mess comes from intolerance.

We should have zero impunity with intolerant people.

## Listen to Good Music, Like Initials BB

![woman wearing sunglasses and polka-dot brassiere](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560233163-60593405546d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

OK, I'll admit there's another key to productivity. I think it's called a diet. For example, are you a big fan of Schopenhauer? Or maybe Nietzche or Kierkegaard?

Once I read something from Schopenhauer that helped me I guess. He was saying that we should expect less and we will live a better life. What about Peter Kingsberry asking for "only the very best (a reasonable request)"?

Lately, I was reading a book from Goethe and excerpts from the diary of a character mentioned that "every spoken word implies contradiction". That was a brilliant demonstration.

I listen to jazz, blues, soul, rock, funk and electronic music. And such a diversity is a hell of a competitive advantage. Once, I decided to spend time in jam sessions and felt like Rafael Nadal winning his first Roland Garros.

But now it's not my priority anymore and there's a key ingredient missing from life.

## In The Long Run, Motivation Fluctuates

![blue and white heart illustration](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1620121478247-ec786b9be2fa?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

For a strange reason, the world fluctuates. But I have the solution: it's called the shadows. They are everywhere like the CIA or the FBI. Incredible how they have troubles with justice and modesty.

This a bit of a private joke but maybe the cold is related to aging. Anyway, the deadline for that blog is 2020. If I don't get some water by then, I think I will go back to a normal lifestyle: when are the holidays?

When you grow old, or maybe when you're passionate about what you do, you're losing track of time. That's where we all want to be maybe. Until the clock sounds the midnight hour.

I look like I'm in another world, but I can read my audience mind.

What does winning imply? At any game possible. It means that somebody will lose. Who remains to be determined. As strange as it might seem, this is based on a true story. I was 22 years old and I was vulnerable.

## Famous Last Words: Make The Best of the Situation

![minicar on top of map](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1640282693834-f941c0c012aa?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

As a conclusion, a deadline is key when it comes to production. Of course, a proper diet (maybe an optimal diet) is also important. Production should be regular and of high quality.

My deadline was 750 words today. I have to write 1200 words though. Otherwise, Google will think my blog is worthless. My mindset was back to basics!

The key to productivity is a deadline. But of course, without a proper diet, you will end up vomiting. That pizza gross, heavy and full of disgust.

You can call it Queen Jealousy but I call it Just Jack. It comes as a shock. I am not a robot (gotcha). The dominant idea with my heart problem is that I might be exercise intolerant.

I tell you people, the deadline is key, even if you're exercise intolerant. OK, the key to success is 2 keys then; on that you can rely.

Is a deadline the only key to production? Is diet a long-term commitment? Was Michael Jordan food poisoned during the famous Flu Game?
