Limp Bizkit already sang about it in 2000 in their hit song "Take a Look Around." They were singing about secrets or a combination. They were also wondering where this Grail was.

Yesterday I was blogging about stories and how sometimes they're not easy to see.

Now I'm glad I found the secret or the combination, and only a happy few will believe in this code. But I can't help but wonder if it doesn't make me a creep.

Information is critical, and ignoring information is like ignoring a truck that is driving your way at 100 miles an hour. The heart knows the difference. And remember the definition of the heart I came up with:
 1. compensation, because you can't always win even though it should be the goal,
 2. precision, because otherwise, I won't make the difference between tea and coffee.

I guess when you are weak, you should stay at home. Or maybe do something to embrace the future. It can't be that dark and full of remorse (disgust and sadness).

## What's The First Thing You Do In The Morning?

ZZ Top used to sing that the first thing they did in the morning was wearing cheap sunglasses. As if the sun was shining too much. Maybe they just meant they have a problem with the distance of the people around them. What if they had a fan that was insulting them because it's hard to face the facts?

Well, I'm broke, but I don't care. Because it's not the first time, and I always managed to get back on track.

Cheap sunglasses means the light is disturbing you. Every day I'm in a coffee shop or restaurant: I don't know why they keep the lights on during the day. I already talked with them about it.

Sometimes you can have strange attitudes or irrational thoughts. But if you're at the right distance where life can thrive, then it shouldn't be a problem.

## What If Justice Was Just Real Slow?

![shallow focus photo of brown snail](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1496079443528-f494019ada49?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

You know what they say about justice: it's very slow because most cases are complex. Or maybe they remembered the lesson from "12 Angry Men". For those who don't know the movie, here is a quick description.

12 Angry Men is a 1957 American courtroom drama film directed by Sidney Lumet, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. This courtroom drama tells the story of a jury of 12 men as they deliberate the conviction or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt, forcing the jurors to question their morals and values. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous.

12 Angry Men explores many techniques of consensus-building and the difficulties encountered in the process among this group of men whose range of personalities adds to the intensity and conflict. It also explores the power one person has to elicit change.

A disgusting mix of intimidation and cowardice can mess you up like your sibling's room. But justice will always be about purest hell and holy cows (rumination and intensity).

## Are They Trying To Make An Angel Out Of You?

I know what you think: this is black magic and only New Orleans' voodoo could explain why you feel like stone. Some friends are vanished and gone. It's about rumination but one should ask the following question.

Do I want to be an angel or a devil? What are the pros and cons?

If you want to be a devil, make sure to check your bones regularly. It seems you can only rely on your sister (maybe 1st-degree cousins) in case there's a problem. If you want to be an angel, people will wonder at some point if you're protecting them.

As in all things, it might be a general adaptation syndrome. Oscar Wilde said he "didn't want to go to heaven because none of his friends were there." But, truth be told, being a devil might be a luxury you can't afford if you care about society.

Again being able to have a healthy mix might also be a solution to your legs feeling like a stone. When are we going to go on holiday?

## Should You Write Or Talk About It?

In summary, to regain your balance and stop feeling like stone, the solution is easy to see: you have to tell your story, but remember to make it short. Normal people don't have time to read. What I mean is that the people you want in your life are busy; otherwise, lazy and selfish people will bring you down.

Give the bottom line and stay as superficial as you can. And make sure you don't have ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).

If you do, you might again have trouble with an Oedipus complex. Freud thought it was the main problem with humanity. Or maybe the main problem is simply invaders that are far away now.

And remember this line from a song by Gil-Scott Heron: you got 10 years to lose if they catch you or if you catch them. I guess he was talking about invaders that are now far away! Sorry, Dr. Freud!
