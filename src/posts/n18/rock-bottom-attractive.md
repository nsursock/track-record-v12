There must be a reason why I'm the king of my castle. To be precise, there must be a reason why rock bottom is comfortable: since it's the lowest point, you can't go down any further. You never treat me like you should.

I always felt rock shared decent energy for a human being. And that may be why it was so successful. We need some energy every day if we want to wake up.

But with rock bottom, it's so lovely to know you won't go down any further in the bottomless pit of rumination and intense emotions. A memory from your lonesome past is making you tired.

With memory, we have to take care of our friends and associations. But thank God it's also a matter of reconstruction. It means memories aren't pictures in your brain. Every day you experience reconstructive memory giving you a chance to make the past better.

## Newspaper Shout About A Little Reconstructive History!

Of course, memory is an associative process. I had ideas for a post and quickly forgot, but I had time to think of the song associated. Suddenly I can remember what my plan was about.

But the second basis of memory (reconstruction) gives you an excellent opportunity to get a grasp on the past. Was your past a bit weird? Then you have a chance to make it better. Was it so perfect you can't forget it? Then your enemies have a chance to make it look not very helpful.

That may be why photography became a significant art form: we have a chance with pictures to have a nondistorted point of view of our past. Some of my early pictures are important at the moment because the mirror is making me look bad. Dorian Gray and Phrygian Purple are my only friends.

## If Heartache Stays, Will I Have To Get A Job?

It's obvious: rock bottom is here to stay. Not for a year, but forever and a day. Let me remind you why: I won't go down further in this bottomless pit we call post-traumatic stress disorder. A memory from my lonesome past is preventing me from going back to normal.

But since I started this music blog, I guess it helps me focus on something else. It's like a potent sedative-hypnotic pill. First, there's a little interest, and suddenly you want to know everything about blogging and how to get your first 1000 daily visitors.

I was wondering how I could make money with this blog. It's been two years, and I've received 3 donations. I must confess that this is not a helpful statistic. But then I discovered a simple thing: if you don't get 1,000 daily visitors, it will be hard to monetize your blog.

## Does Rock Bottom Equal Someone Late For Payment?

Rock bottom: I won't go down any further in this bottomless pit. It's quite amazing that a music genre can achieve this feat. It's a bottomless pit!

It seems as if someone has to pay if I want to get rid of the rock bottom. Let me remind you that someone owes me 25 million dollars, and someone else might also owe me the same sum of money. Lately, I've thought that they would never pay me because they would instead send me to prison.

Let's try to free ourselves from anxiety a little bit: our universe is based on billions of beautiful worlds separated by an ocean of darkness. What if my messages in a bottle never reach the shore? What if I never manage to mimic The Police and the daily $2,000 that they get from the royalties of their song "Every Breath You Take"?

Darkness will fall on the city, and diamonds are a girl's best friend, and content as the king might be a blogger's best friend.

## Do You Know You Ought To Treat Me Good?

In closing, rock bottom is a monstrous weapon if you feel like you're in a bottomless pit. The energy the rock genre can convey is unheard of. Yet some artists like Lenny Kravitz want to remind us some people deemed that "rock was dead."

Another useful tool when your memory is making you nuts is a reconstruction: a chance to rearrange the past and hell. With hell, it's always the same old story: the numbers are disappointing.

Instead of having 25 million dollars at the bank, I have zero, and my parents give me 50â‚¬ a day to enjoy life. When I started working at age 25 (I'm 39 years old), I was making a little more.

Now, all of you who are intolerant to exercise should make sure to check your associations because reconstruction needs a little effort. And, again, never mind hitting rock bottom since you won't go down any further. Next, I might blog about jazz bottom, soul bottom, funk bottom, blues bottom, and electro bottom.
