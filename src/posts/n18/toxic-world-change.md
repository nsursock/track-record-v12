No doubt humanity lives in a land of confusion. And they don't know if it's love or an awful mess. Let me remind the mess can lead you to work for your competitor.

But what kind of world do Millenials dream of? And why should they be the elected generation that will end all wars and famine and helplessness?

I was born in 1980, and I'm 39 years old. I'm a Millenial, and I never thought before 2016 that this could be of any importance. But now I know what was wrong.

My grandparents experienced WW2, and I feel it inside of me. Some might say undercover agents for the blues were all around. Have you ever been mistreated? You know what I'm talking about.

Will Daddy pay for your crashed car and strange experiences? Let's try to understand what kind of world Millenials want.

## Will Years Of Negligence And Treason Make You Ashamed?

From my point of view, there's no debate about what happened since 2001. Criminal negligence and never far from high treason: this is what everybody will have to face when the mirror gives you the look.

I know what you think: you manage to rest only if you are indifferent and cold. But when I think of the 3rd world, some leading artists have trouble closing the eyes.

One should take risks in life, and of course, people are demanding. And you know the point of view of the wolf on that critical subject: you will learn to fail elegantly and succeed massively. By the way, the wolf is always at the door, so you'd better take care of your own.

Nothing matters to them because they want to be bohemians, and they're never far from treason remembering their high school days. Do you think our elites thought there were too many children?

## When The Children Play Will You Feel Relieved?

I remember one day asking one of my managers if he had children. It seems there are strange games and funky things. Any funk artist will be able to talk about it.

The #1 reason why we're experiencing nausea about the game of life is the family tree.

I don't know about your family, but my maternal grandfather was the 1st polytechnician of Lebanon (Polytechnic is an important school in France). The reason it's famous might be their attention to details and their skills in any situation.

My paternal grandfather experienced two world wars before founding a family (he was born in 1893, and he married at age 53). Last but not least, my family is of Byzantine origin, and it seems the heritage of Byzantium is of interest.

The first reason that may make you want to quit is your family tree. But now let's explore the 2nd reason why you feel dizzy.

## Is Your Heart So Insane It Shows On Your Valuable Hands?

![person showing arm tattoo](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1530785404354-f4ed0206a0d1?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

The 2nd reason you don't want to play and consider quitting is, of course, the signs of the times. If you're lucky enough or messed up enough, it seems your heart will transpire in the palm of your hands.

Suddenly you started singing about love and pain. You know musical genocide isn't for you.

But again you might be at a famous school with clear and exciting mottos like the one I attended in 1998 until 2002: "damn get naked".

I met a Syrian creative a few months ago, and he told me the era was peculiar. A few days ago, I posted on Reddit "Small Business", and one of the people answering me wrote: "Good luck OP (original poster), these are hard times."

If you were born in 1917 in Leidenstadt, what will your future look like? And now, I want to finish and specify how the world should be.

## Need A Genuine World Where Kindness Doesn't Mean Weakness?

![wall sign about kindness](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1602973507597-0cb4b3551a19?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

If only fools are kind, then I guess it's wise to be cruel. Since 2001, life is so demanding that one can wonder what the problem is. It seems the problem was a school. To be more precise, the problem was a girls' school that started accepting boys (who have a sister).

I once read that all women exhibit some castrating behavior. But I wonder if the malicious castration isn't the work of our dedicated police (maybe also the thought police then). I don't care about the different thoughts, and I'm telling everything on this music blog.

If you're having a hard time making your conscience clear, let me remind you that, for psychologists, conscience is like the Holy Grail. My hands and my family are showing the way.

We're missing someone, and the heart knows the difference between a friend and a monster. In case of doubt, please don't show any kindness.
