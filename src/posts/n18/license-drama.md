Recently I was talking with some friends and talked to them about my secret code to find a hidden meaning in words with 5 characters. At first, they were full of doubt but I'm going to show what my secret codes can do for you as a writer or a poet.

Bonus: if you are bored and want to have fun, you can order the full codes for words between 3 and 9 characters.

Anyway, considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BC)â€”the earliest work of dramatic theory. The term "drama" comes from a Greek word meaning "action", which is derived from "I do". The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy.

It's funny how drama is all about action and psychologists that know the Do/Feel/Think cycle will be delighted. But what I'm going to write then makes a lot of sense.

## Was It Austerity That Created The Action?

At the moment, there is a revolution going on in Lebanon. Our prime minister repeated to us that "if we want to win, we have to bet on austerity". This means we have to wait for the turn of a friendly card and it could take forever.

I do believe austerity can create drama and action. The Lebanese revolution is a troubling sign that waiting for the sun all your life can be a very bad bet. Especially in a Mediterranean country enjoying 300 days of sun a year (only Almeria can beat us).

As a businessman and a blogger, I have to think of my life a little bit if I want to make a profit. Of course, I want to find solutions to the problem as if I was a sociologist. We have to make the best of the situation before we go insane.

## Was It An Insane Desire To Have A Good Summer?

I guess there's no crisis: if you can't go on holiday then drama will unfold and we will be at the heart of the action. This is the strangest summer I have ever known: I wrote on the blog almost every day instead of playing football with random guys and going to the swimming pool.

Now I wake up and it's almost winter. As if we were in New York, Lebanon can sometimes enjoy an Indian summer which means the autumn season resembles the summer one. If you didn't go on holiday, don't be surprised by the revolution.

This is so strange that it's hardly believable. 18 years without holidays and the memory of a strange summer in my childhood that lingers on like a night in Tunisia.

At the heart of every drama, there's always a sad and strange affair.

## Who Has The Electronic Right To Do That?

At the heart of every drama, there's also a problem of justice and pressure. The last 4 years have been so strange that now I have to forget school even though there's some upside in it. A teacher woke me up badly while I was sleeping and it became degenerate.

Now, with the internet and telecommunications, people can hurt you in so many new ways.

Take for example a keylogger: I shouldn't write about this. With a keylogger, you can know everything someone types on a computer. Might as well face it: the challenge of the future is of course privacy.

Justice is all about pressure and an atmosphere that only music can render precisely. That's why I'm writing songs without a word at the moment. Who can write a poem after WW2?

## Is There A Kind Of Justice Under The Sky?

![grayscale photo of woman holding i love you to the moon and back](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598338430862-3e3098daa722?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

As a conclusion, dramatic things are, of course, related to austerity and strange affairs. But the main problem is always the same: justice. When I was young, I didn't bother too much with justice. I found other people bothered deeply by what we were going through.

Now it becomes harder and harder to find someone to understand me. I'm 39 years old and sometimes I feel like I'm 90 years old. I feel like someone talked about me all over town saying it was a crying shame.

I'm making the most of the losing streak though. I've got 10 years to lose if someone catches me trying to fight the ghetto blues. And that's why today there's some action.

I'm writing on that internet (or maybe I'm whispering). I know it can make some people dizzy (even myself).
