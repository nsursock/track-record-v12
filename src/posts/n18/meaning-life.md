Lately, Freud considered I was ill because I was thinking about the meaning of life. So I started to read various authors about it, but I had to give my regard and opinion on the subject.

I have two clues about the meaning of life that I'm going to share with you: the first clue could be that our time is limited. And the second clue could be that you brought joy inside our tears.

One last clue is that the meaning of life is a mystery that tends to fade. I guess people can remind you easily about what life is like. One man's loss is another man's gain sometimes.

It's like a jungle sometimes; this is what life is about. And I know many people who lost their head even if they didn't give head (including myself trying to make this blog a success).

Let's talk about the different clues and choose an option. Let me give you a nice teaser: I do think it's about the fact our time is limited.

## To Be Honest, Does Anything Good Come Easy?

The first option about the meaning of life was: joy inside my tears. Of course, life is about pleasure and pain. Everyone will tell you there is no secret in life, and you have to work hard and have a strong ethic.

The result, if you succeed, is that you will have joy inside your tears. But only if you succeed. Otherwise, prepare for a few nightmares.

This option is an interesting one, but we will see I prefer another one.

Nothing good comes easy except maybe by chance. What you call chance is attention to detail (according to Winston Churchill). So as you can see, it's another result of a correct analysis of a situation.

## This Is What Happens When Life's Mystery Fades Away

Lately, I thought my life was too hard, and I should talk with God. But something crossed my mind: is my vision of life the right one? For example, I'm thinking of monstrous love, crimes against humanity, and being drunk with rivalry and vengeance.

Life's mystery shouldn't fade. Usually, it happens because you lost contact with your inner child. Maybe someone kicked your ass too much.

Sometimes it's hard to get over something or someone. Maybe that's because the person is easy, and he/she took your heart without feeling it.

Life's mystery should be obvious to have a satisfying life. Benjamin Netanyahu recently said that life is about competition. Maybe he has a point, but what if life's mystery was about speed? How long does it take you to write a 750 words blog post?

## What If Our Time Was Lavishly Limited?

So if life is about speed, does that mean my best option for the meaning of life is that our time is limited? My time is limited, and I have to write three pages in one hour (if possible).

We all got our reasons for doing something slowly or fast. Did you notice how time passes differently if you speak with an attractive person of the opposite sex?

Time passes quickly according to the band Toto, and we don't have many chances in life. What if life's mystery was about 2nd chance points? What if it was about having rights but no obligations?

The meaning of life is a sensitive subject. The meaning of life, or the answer to the question: "What is the meaning of life?", pertains to the significance of living or existence in general. Many other related questions include: "Why are we here?", "What is life all about?", or "What is the purpose of existence?"

## Another Surprisingly Dodgy Subject To Blog About

![orange post near gray concrete stairs](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1575672940345-aa3e5baa0d3d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

Overall, I like the last option about the meaning of life: our time is limited. Otherwise, if we had forever, why bother now?

But there are several other interesting options. Life is about having the back of someone, or life is about having no obligations. This last option seems unrealistic; however, it could make sense if you're a gambler or a trader.

There have been many proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much philosophical, scientific, theological, and metaphysical speculation throughout history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question.

The meaning of life as we perceive it is derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness. Many other issues are also involved, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

Our time is limited, that's for sure; otherwise how come things happen? Why did Jamiroquai sing "Emergency on Planet Earth"?
