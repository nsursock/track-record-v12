## **Title**: *When God Takes Risks: Faith, Fortune, and the Shadows We Walk Through*

---

### **I. Introduction – [Set the Stage]**

* **Hook**: What if even the divine gambles on us—and sometimes, the silence is the answer?
* **Context**: Inspired by the soulful plea in Aloe Blacc's "I Need a Dollar," this plan explores the idea that God, or fate, takes risks on our behalf, but when nothing seems to change, it may be a sign we're in a dark place, not abandoned.
* **Thesis**: I will argue that the apparent absence of change or intervention in our lives is not evidence of neglect, but a reflection of our own state of mind and circumstance—a darkness that can obscure even the boldest acts of grace.
* **Song**: I need a dollar by Aloe Blacc

### **II. Thesis – [Present Your Main Argument]**

* **A. Divine Risk-Taking**

  * Example: Stories of unexpected blessings or "miracles" that arrive when least expected.
  * Analysis: These moments suggest that the universe (or God) is not passive, but actively invests in us, sometimes in ways we don't immediately see.
  * Song: suggest a song from jazz, blues, soul, rock, funk or electro

* **B. The Silence of Stagnation**

  * Example: Times when prayers or efforts seem to go unanswered, echoing the desperation in "I Need a Dollar."
  * Analysis: This silence is not always a "no," but may be a pause—a space for growth or self-discovery.
  * Song: Chris Rea - Stop

* **C. The Role of Darkness**

  * Example: Personal or collective struggles (financial, emotional, spiritual) that feel endless.
  * Analysis: Darkness can be a place of transformation, where risks are still being taken on our behalf, but the results are hidden from view.
  * Song: Muse - Darkshines

### **III. Antithesis – [Present the Counterargument or Opposing View]**

* **A. The Argument for Divine Indifference**

  * Example: The problem of evil or suffering—why do bad things happen to good people?
  * Critique: This view is persuasive because it aligns with our experience of unanswered need and apparent randomness.
  * Song: Genesis - Tell me why

* **B. The Case for Self-Reliance**

  * Example: The belief that only personal effort, not divine intervention, changes circumstances.
  * Critique: This perspective is empowering, but can lead to isolation or despair when efforts fail.
  * Song: Isolation - Joe Cocker or Jeff Beck with Depp

* **C. Emotional or Social Cost**

  * Discuss: The loneliness and hopelessness that can arise when one feels abandoned by both God and society.
  * Song: Jimi Hendrix - Burning of Midnight Lamp

### **IV. Synthesis – [Reconcile or Move Beyond the Debate]**

* **A. Propose Solutions or New Perspectives**

  * Describe: Embrace both faith and action—recognize that risks are taken on our behalf, but we must also move toward the light.
  * Express: Hope that even in darkness, change is possible if we remain open to it.
  * Song: Amazing - Aerosmith

* **B. Highlight Collaborative or Mutual Approaches**

  * Discuss: Community support, shared struggles, and collective faith can help illuminate the risks being taken for us.
  * Song: Writings on the wall - Sam Mendes

* **C. Rethink Key Concepts**

  * Suggest: Redefine "divine intervention" as something that can be subtle, internal, or communal—not always dramatic or immediate.
  * Song: Sowing the seeds of love by Tears for fears

### **V. Conclusion – [Reflect and Challenge]**

* **Restate**: The absence of visible change is not proof of divine neglect, but may be a sign of the darkness we're moving through—a darkness that can be transformed.
* **Call to awareness**: Consider how your own perspective or community might be obscuring the risks and gifts being offered to you.
* **Final line**: When you find yourself in the dark, ask not just for a dollar, but for the courage to see the risks being taken on your behalf. 
* **Song**: U2 - Ultraviolet (light my way)
